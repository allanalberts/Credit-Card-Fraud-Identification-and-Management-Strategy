There are multiple approaches to how this fraud review process can be managed. One approach would be to review all suspected fraud transactions while another approach would be to automatically cancel some of the suspected fraud without manaully reviewing the transactins. These different operatinal strategies have different impacts on our fraud losses, operational expenses and customer satisfaction. By building different cost matrix, we can measure what the impacts would be from employing different operational strategies. \n",
